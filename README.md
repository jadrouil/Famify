This project has ground to a halt. The purpose was to get comfortable with Java. That has been accomplished. 

Unfortunately, me gaining familiarity with Java did not coincide with the completion of this project. 

What work is left to be done?

1. Build a system for multiple users to authorize the application. Such a system needs to redirect users to a permission granting page.
2. Store and refresh access tokens.
3. Use each users access token to retrieve top tracks.
